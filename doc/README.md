# Project: 
### Doc folder

The doc directory contains the report or presentation files. It can have subfolders.  

+Fall2017-proj1-cw2974.rmd：The original file

+Fall2017-proj1-cw2974.html: can be reproduced by knitting Fall2017-proj1-cw2974.rmd

+Fall2017-proj1-cw2974-nb-nb.html: It is not directly from Fall2017-proj1-cw2974.rmd. As the file directed from rmd file has some display issues(image too large), I adjust it and make a new file.
