### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2017

+ Projec title:  Does Trump's inaugural speech indicate his second term in office?
+ This project is conducted by Chenyun Wu

+ Project summary: [a short summary] It is surprising that Donald J Trump became the US president last year. He made hard work of beating Hilary Clinton and has almost finished his first year in office.
People seem like getting adapted to this new president, but will he win again?

In this analysis, we select presidents' first inaugural speeches to track whether these speeches indicate a second term of office.
By comparing the different patterns between presidents with 2 or more terms and those who only have 1 term in office, we will get some interesting facts about these groups and we can also use the pattern extracted anticipating the future of Trump.

Also, some people believe that Trump is not that special as a Republican president. When George Bush was in his term, he also did something laughable in public. So, we will take this factor into consideration and further break the data into democratic presidents and republican presidents.
